# CandyQuest


This is the code for an auto-clicker for the CandyQuest Telegram Minigame. It uses a autohotkey script binded to a python gui script to execute.

Make sure you have python, all the packages installed, and autohotkey.

INSTALLS:
https://www.autohotkey.com/****
#pip install keyboard, pyautogui, time and os.

Key things that make this work:
Update your region to ensure your capturing the right display. (THIS WAS BUILT FOR THE APP TO RUN IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER OF YOUR SCREEN)
Ensure the mini-game is the only window open when starting the script.
Update your autohotkey script to point to the path of your script. (If using vscode can simply right click your script file and click copy path and then paste it into the .ahk file, then save it.)





Code can be found in the masterbranch and comments should be pretty self-explanatory.


Happy candy farmingüç≠
